CCSystems
=========

ComputerCraft Systems is a collection of scripts I use in computercraft to make certain tasks easier or to automate systems in a minecraft world.

To install a program, you can either install directly with the github command from openperipherals (or your own github script), or use the install script.  The install script uses the openp/github command, so be sure to have that available.  Some of these scripts will not work without openperipherals.

To get the install script, run the command github get ComputerCraftSystems/CCSystems/master/install.lua install

Note: as of ComputerCraft ~1.6, the HTTP capabilities of computers are added by default, but github is not on the white-list of domains for 1.6.3.  You will need to modify the value of http_whitelist in the ComputerCraft configuration file to either allow connections to github, or connections to all sites.
