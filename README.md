OCSystems
=========

OpenComputers Systems is a collection of scripts I use in the Minecraft mod OpenComputers to make certain tasks easier or to automate systems in a minecraft world.

Since this repository is in the process of being ported from ComputerCraft, many things will not work correctly until the porting is done.

To get the install script, run the command github get ComputerCraftSystems/CCSystems/master/install.lua install

Note: as of ComputerCraft ~1.6, the HTTP capabilities of computers are added by default, but github is not on the white-list of domains for 1.6.3.  You will need to modify the value of http_whitelist in the ComputerCraft configuration file to either allow connections to github, or connections to all sites.
